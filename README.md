# IDMentor - getElementById ,but better

I didn't find something similar to that in Vs Code Extensions, so I decided to make my extension which helps you grab faster elements from html and create JS variables with selectors.

## Usage

Open any document contain HTML and do one of the following:

- Select a code sequence and press `ctrl+alt+i`, this will get all elements with `id=""` and/or `class=""` to your clipboard.
- Paste them `ctrl+v` in a `<script></script>` or a `JS` file.

> Tip: You can select only a code sequence, it's not necessary to select all the page.
